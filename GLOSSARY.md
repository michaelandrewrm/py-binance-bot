## Trading Terms

### **ATR (Average True Range)**
A volatility indicator that measures the magnitude of price movements over a specified period. Used to set dynamic stop-losses and position sizing based on market volatility.

### **Volatility Bands**
Price channels constructed around a moving average using volatility measurements (typically ATR multiples). Used for trend-following strategies to identify breakouts and reversals.

### **Mean Reversion**
A trading strategy based on the assumption that asset prices will return to their historical average over time. Involves buying oversold conditions and selling overbought conditions.

### **OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)**

### **Signal Confidence**
A quantitative measure (typically 0.0-1.0) indicating the reliability or strength of a trading signal. Higher confidence suggests greater probability of successful trade execution.

### **Grid Trading**
A systematic trading approach that places multiple buy and sell orders at predetermined price levels, creating a "grid" of orders to profit from market volatility.

### **Position Sizing**
The process of determining the appropriate quantity of an asset to buy or sell based on risk management parameters, account size, and market conditions.

### **Position Limit**
The maximum allowable position size for a single trade or overall portfolio exposure, typically expressed as a percentage of total capital.

### **Stop-Loss**
A predetermined price level at which a losing position is automatically closed to limit further losses.

### **Take-Profit**
A predetermined price level at which a winning position is automatically closed to secure profits.

## System Architecture Terms

### **API Rate Limiting**
The restriction of the number of API requests that can be made within a specific time period to prevent system overload and ensure fair usage.

### **State Persistence**
The ability of a system to save its current state to storage and restore it after a restart, ensuring continuity of operations.

### **Async/Await**
A programming pattern that allows for non-blocking, concurrent execution of operations, particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks like API calls.

### **Paper Trading**
A simulation mode that allows testing of trading strategies using real market data without actual financial risk.

### **Backtesting**
The process of testing a trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its potential effectiveness before deploying it with real money.

## Exchange Terms

### **Testnet**
A test network provided by exchanges that simulates real trading conditions without using actual funds, used for testing and development.

### **Order Book**
A list of buy and sell orders for a specific security, organized by price level, showing market depth and liquidity.

### **Tick Size**
The minimum price increment at which a security can be traded on an exchange.

### **Step Size**
The minimum quantity increment for placing orders, determining the precision of order quantities.

### **Minimum Notional**
The minimum value requirement for an order, calculated as quantity Ã— price, ensuring orders meet exchange standards.

### **Maker/Taker Fees**
Different fee structures where makers add liquidity to the order book (lower fees) and takers remove liquidity (higher fees).

## Performance Metrics

### **Win Rate**
The percentage of trades that result in a profit, calculated as (winning trades / total trades) Ã— 100.

### **Profit Factor**
The ratio of gross profit to gross loss, indicating overall strategy profitability. Values above 1.0 indicate profitable strategies.

### **Calmar Ratio**
